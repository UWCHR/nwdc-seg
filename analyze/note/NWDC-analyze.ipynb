    "\"We are seeking all records (including written documents, files, electronic communications, records or reports of any sort) describing or reviewing the placement of detainees in segregation (including both administrative and disciplinary segregation) at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, WA, from September 2013 to the present. This includes both notifications of initial placement in segregation as well as regular reviews performed in cases of extended segregation. We ask that documents be redacted to protect inmate privacy.\"\n",

    "The request was acknowledged by ICE on October 4, 2017 and assigned Case Number 2018-ICFO-00515. During the following year UWCHR made various requests for status updates. On February 26, 2018, an ICE FOIA officer acknowledged that the request was active.\n",

    "On September 21, 2018, the University of Washington filed suit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for violations of FOIA, including failure to respond to this request in a timely manner (The University of Washington, et al. v. Department of Homeland Security, et al.\n",

Plaintiffs are seeking the underlying records which ICE used to create this spreadsheet, such as Administrative Detention Orders. _Second_, Plaintiffs have an Administrative Detention Order which shows that one particular detainee was sent to solitary confinement on 8/8/2017. This entry is not included in the spreadsheet ICE produced, which makes Plaintiffs question the thoroughness and accuracy of the spreadsheet as a representation of the underlying data.\" (March 12, 2019 letter by UW counsel Thomas R.
